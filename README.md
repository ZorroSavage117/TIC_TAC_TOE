# Overview


Overview
I've developed a Tic Tac Toe game as part of my learning journey as a software engineer. The game allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking spaces on the grid with their respective symbols ('X' and 'O'). The game ends when one player successfully forms a row, column, or diagonal with three of their symbols, or when the grid is filled without a winner resulting in a draw.

My purpose in writing this software is to practice and enhance my skills in game development, particularly in creating simple interactive games using Python and the Arcade library. This project serves as a learning opportunity to understand game logic, user input handling, and graphical interface design.

# Future Work

In the future, I plan to:

* Add options for players to choose game modes, including playing against a computer AI.
* Improve the game's graphical interface with more polished visuals and user-friendly menus.
